## I have included Graphical User Interface (GUI) Python Projects in this Repository.

### About Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
The GUI, or graphical user interface, is a type of user interface that can be used on desktop computers, or mobile phones to represent the actions and operations of the user. These applications can receive inputs through mouse clicks and can enable the user to choose from alternatives with the help of radio buttons, dropdown lists, and other GUI elements (or widgets). For the GUI, Python UI libraries can be used. Everyone is probably know that Tkinter is among the best and most widely used Python GUI library. 

### About Python Tkinter Library:

A collection of tools called Tkinter, which allows Python to be used to render graphical user interfaces. Tkinter is the Python port for Tcl-Tk GUI toolkit developed by Fredrik Lundh. It enables the GUI-based execution of Python scripts. Initially, import the TKinter module. After importing, use the Tk() function to set up the application object. This will create a basic window also known as root, a frame will display title bar, control box with the minimize and close buttons, and some space to hold other widgets. All Tkinter widget classes are inherited from the Widget class. Using these classes you can create perfect GUI. 

### Project1 Description. 
- Project Name: **REAL-TIME DIGITAL CLOCK AND DATE DISPLAY WITH GUI USING PYTHON.**
- The project is written in Python. 
- The implementation of this project involves the utilization of tkinter and time thses two Python libraries.
- The tkinter library is used for creating the graphical user interface.
- The time module is used for retrieving the current time and date.
- The "Real-Time Digital Clock and Date" project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the Tkinter library in Python.
- Within the scope of this project, I've introduced a "Digital_Clock" class, which incorporates various functions, with each function dedicated to constructing specific graphical elements (widgets). This class initializes the GUI window, sets up the clock and date display frames, and continuously updates the time and date.
- Run the script, and a GUI window will appear on the screen. 
- Digital Clock Display: The application presents a digital clock on the user's screen, showing the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. The time is updated in real-time. (e.g., 01:45:00 PM) 
- Date Display: The GUI also displays the current date, including the month, day, and year. (e.g., 10/25/2023) 
- GUI Layout: The GUI is divided into two sections. The top section displays the digital clock, while the bottom section shows the date. The clock and date are presented in distinct frames with different background colors for easy differentiation.
- In summary, this project has provided practical experience in GUI development, class-based programming, and real-time data display.

### Project2 Description. 
- Project Name: **DIGITAL CALCULATOR WITH GUI USING PYTHON.**
- The project is written in Python.
- The "Digital Calculator with GUI using Python" project is a graphical calculator application created using the Tkinter library.
- It provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations.
- In this project, several classes and functions are used to create the calculator's graphical user interface and perform arithmetic calculations.
- The "Calculator" class is the main class that contains the calculator's functionality and the graphical user interface. It serves as the central controller for the calculator application.
- Functions used are Initialization (__init__), Button Functions (number, operator, equal, clear, square, sqrt), Button Widgets (num_buttons, operator_buttons, equaltoo_button, clear_button, square_button, sqrt_button), Event Handling (bind_keys), Label Update Functions (update_frame1, update_frame2), Close Function (close).
- Run the script, and a GUI window for the calculator will appear.
- The calculator features a graphical user interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, clear functions, and special operations like square and square root.
- Users can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The calculator offers special operations like squaring a number (x²) and finding the square root (√x).
- Use the mouse to click the buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and special functions (square and square root).
- Alternatively, you can use keyboard input to perform calculations. Press the number keys and operator keys for input, then press "Enter" to calculate.
- The calculator displays the entered numbers and operations in real-time on the screen.
- The calculator can handle certain errors gracefully, such as displaying "Error" when an invalid expression is entered.
- This project taught me GUI development, event handling, real-time display updates, and error handling.
