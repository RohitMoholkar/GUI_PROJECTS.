## I've included all of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) Python Projects in this repository.

### About Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
The GUI, or graphical user interface, is a type of user interface that can be used onÂ desktop computers, or mobile phones to represent the actions and operations of the user. These applications can receive inputs through mouse clicks and can enable the user to choose from alternatives with the help of radio buttons, dropdown lists, and other GUI elements (or widgets).
